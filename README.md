Data Interpretation
1. The voltage gradually decreases from about 100 to 92 over time, remaining stable initially before showing a steady downward trend.
2. Voltage readings were recorded at regular 10–20 second intervals, giving a detailed view of changes over the 7-day period.
3. The dataset clearly shows voltage degradation, with values dropping from 100 to around 92 by the end of monitoring.
4. The assignment.ipynb analysis shows both gradual decline and sudden voltage drops, typical of battery discharge or system degradation.
5. Signal processing identified distinct peaks and dips, indicating possible critical points or anomalies in the system.
